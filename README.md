# Willow Sparks's PHYS379 Project Repo

## Welcome!
This repository contains all of the work done by myself, Ana Villarubia-Palac√≠n, Sid Richards and Sam Wade on the PHYS379 group project of our Theoretical Physics degrees at Lancaster University.

We implemented a simulation of two algorithms: [Grover's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grover%27s_algorithm) and [Shor's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shor%27s_algorithm). Grover's algorithm was used to search a database of exoplanets ranked by their [Earth Similarity Inxdex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth_Similarity_Index), and Shor's algorithm was used to break 8-bit RSA.

For a more detailed discussion, have a read of PHYS379-Group-3-Quantum-Computing-B-Report.pdf!

At some point I might write a more detailed explanation of the code and how this repo works, if there's demand.
